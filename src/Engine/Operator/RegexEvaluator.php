/**
 * Evaluates values against a PCRE regular expression (@rx operator).
 *
 * ModSecurity/CRS @rx patterns are bare PCRE content (never pre-delimited),
 * so the pattern is always wrapped in '~...~u' with any unescaped '~' escaped.
 * Previous versions also tried to auto-detect "already-delimited" patterns by
 * checking whether the first and last characters matched — this misfired on
 * real CRS rules whose patterns happen to start and end with the same literal
 * character (notably backticks in rule 942510), turning those characters into
 * PCRE delimiters and collapsing the rule to its inner alternation.
 *
 * Values exceeding {@see self::MAX_SUBJECT_LENGTH} bytes are truncated to that length
 * and the head is inspected, bounding regex work on attacker-controlled input without letting a
 * payload evade detection simply by padding past the limit. A subject that triggers a PCRE engine
 * error (malformed UTF-8 under the /u flag, backtrack/recursion limit) is treated as a match so a
 * crafted value cannot disable a rule by forcing the error.
